Fork of the reboothack 2020 webpage. NOT maintained. Only for personal use

## Project running
I will deploy this project to heroku or a similar service.\
I will do it in near future.\
note: The original project is deployed to www.reboothack.is - this is only a fork of that project. For personal use.


### About project
Site that was built for Reboot Hack 2020.\
I was a part of a project management group, me and two others had the main project to build, maintain and update this website.\
It is built with nodeJS(express) server, nodemailer email service that sends confirmation email to applicants, and webpack to handle css bundles.\
ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap to build the front-end part.

### 
I will update and add more to the README when I deploy the site live.
